# Syntax
The CX syntax is mostly like C (if you are coming here from C, [read this](coming-from-c.md)) but with a couple of changes. 
## Token types
A **token** is a single word in a CX script. Tokens have different types. We will go through them here.
### Keywords
**Keywords** are predefined words that define the [tag](#tags) of a line.  
`[keyword] [...]`
the keyword is the first token in the line. 
### Variables
**Variables** are tokens that are the identifier for a value. Don't worry, we'll cover these later.  
`[...][variable][...]`
